# Profile API

- 05/08/2023

Note

The use of this API is restricted to those developers approved by LinkedIn and subject to applicable data restrictions in their agreements.

The Profile API returns a member's LinkedIn profile, subject to the member's privacy settings.

[Section titled: Usage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/integrations/people/profile-api#usage)

## Usage

You must use an access token to make an [authenticated call](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow) on behalf of a user.

Note

You may only store data returned from the Profile API for the authenticated members with their permission. Please refer to this [document](https://legal.linkedin.com/storing-member-data) for guidance on storing authenticated member data. You may never store data returned from the Profile API for members other than the authenticated member.

[Section titled: Retrieve Other Member's Profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/integrations/people/profile-api#retrieve-other-members-profile)

## Retrieve Other Member's Profile

To retrieve another member's profile, you will need access to the `Person ID`, available only via certain limited access APIs and subject to member privacy settings.

Copy

```lang-https
GET https://api.linkedin.com/v2/people/(id:{person ID})

```

You can also retrieve multiple profiles at once:

Copy

```lang-https
GET https://api.linkedin.com/v2/people?ids=List((id:{Person ID1}),(id:{Person ID2}),(id:{Person ID3}))

```

Note

In order to make the sample calls above succeed, you must include `X-RestLi-Protocol-Version:2.0.0` in your request header.

This API will only return data for members who haven't limited their [Off-LinkedIn Visibility](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/79854).

[Section titled: Field Selections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/integrations/people/profile-api#field-selections)

## Field Selections

By default, only the [Lite Profile Fields](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/references/v2/profile/lite-profile) are returned for a profile request.Â See the [Profile Fields](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/references/v2/profile) document for a full list of supported fields.

To request more or less fields, you must have additional permissions that are only granted to select partners. Please refer to the [field projections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/api-guide/concepts/projections) on proper syntax. Below is a sample request:

Copy

```lang-https
GET https://api.linkedin.com/v2/people/(id:{profile ID})?projection=(id,firstName,lastName)

```

[Section titled: Person ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/integrations/people/profile-api#person-id)

## Person ID

The `id` returned in the response is the unique identifier of the user. This should be stored and referenced where possible as LinkedIn APIs utilize both [URNs and IDs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/api-guide/concepts/urns). In our API documentation, we reference this `id` as `person ID`.

Note

Each member `id` is unique to the context of your application only. Sharing a `person ID` across applications will not work and result in a 404 error.

[Section titled: Public Profile URL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/integrations/people/profile-api#public-profile-url)

## Public Profile URL

The `vanityName` from [Basic Profile Fields](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/references/v2/profile/basic-profile) is used to represent the public profile URL in the follow format: `www.linkedin.com/in/{vanityName}`.

[Section titled: New Location Display Name](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/integrations/people/profile-api#new-location-display-name)

## New Location Display Name

The `geoLocation` from [Location Fields](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/references/v2/profile/location) is the new location field. As LinkedIn transitions through the Bing Geo location migration, we will try to maintain backwards compatibility with the legacy [location](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/references/v2/profile/location) and `locationName` field as much as possible.

Note

All use of the Microsoft Bing Maps location data is subject to [Microsoft Bing Maps and MapPoint Web Service End User Terms of Use and Embedded Maps Service Terms of Use](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/product/terms-april-2011) and the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839). By accessing any Microsoft Bing Maps location data, you are agreeing to be bound by these Microsoft terms.

To determine a member's profile location, refer to the [geoLocation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/references/v2/profile/location) field. If the `autoGenerated` field is `false`, then the member's location has already migrated to Bing Geo taxonomy. This means that the most up-to-date display name is retrieved from `geo` field in `geoLocation`. If the field is `true`, then you can rely on either `location` or `geo` in `geoLocation`.

In order to get the display name from the geo URN value of `geo` field, please use the [Geo API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/references/v2/standardized-data/locations/geo). Alternatively, you can utilize decoration in your Profile request:

Copy

```lang-https
GET https://api.linkedin.com/v2/me?projection=(geoLocation(geo~,autoGenerated))

GET https://api.linkedin.com/v2/people/(id:{person ID})?projection=(geoLocation(geo~,autoGenerated))

```

Copy

```lang-json
{
  "geoLocation": {
    "geo": "urn:li:geo:12345",
    "autoGenerated": false,
    "geo~": {
      "id": 12345,
      "defaultLocalizedName": {
        "locale": {
          "country": "US",
          "language": "en"
        },
        "value": "San Francisco Bay Area"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

[Section titled: Legacy Location Display Name](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/integrations/people/profile-api#legacy-location-display-name)

## Legacy Location Display Name

The `location` from [Profile Fields](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/references/v2/profile) contains several fields that are used to determine the member's displayed location nam

If the `userSelectedGeoPlaceCode` is present, then you will need to call [Places API - GET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/references/v2/standardized-data/locations/places#get) to retrieve the name. To use the API, you will need to translate the `countryCode` to a countryURN by simply appending `urn:li:country:` in front of the code. See below for an example:

Copy

```lang-JSON
{
   "location":{
      "postalCode":"12345",
      "standardizedLocationUrn":"urn:li:standardizedLocationKey:(us,12345)",
      "userSelectedGeoPlaceCode":"1-1-0-23-30",
      "countryCode":"us"
   }
}

```

Copy

```lang-https
GET https://api.linkedin.com/v2/places/country=urn:li:country:us&placeCode=1-1-0-23-30

```

If the `userSelectedGeoPlaceCode` is **NOT** present, then you will need to call [Regions API - FINDER standardizedLocation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/references/v2/standardized-data/locations/regions#finder-standardizedlocation) to retrieve the name. To use the API, you will input the `standardizedLocationUrn` value into the `standardizedLocation` parameter. See below for an example:

Copy

```lang-JSON
{
   "location":{
      "postalCode":"12345",
      "standardizedLocationUrn":"urn:li:standardizedLocationKey:(us,12345)",
      "countryCode":"us"
   }
}

```

Copy

```lang-https
GET https://api.linkedin.com/v2/regions?q=standardizedLocation&standardizedLocation=urn:li:standardizedLocationKey:(us,12345)

```

Once you make the appropriate request, you can simply retrieve the display location name from the `value` of the `name` field for each respective API.
